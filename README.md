## to see my soft skills or other stuff (certificates), acess my LinkedIn -----> https://www.linkedin.com/in/vicenzo-castelli/

My name is Pedro and I'm a 19-year-old student currently in my fifth semester of graduation. Since I'm majoring in Information Systems, my interests are naturally skewed towards technology, problem solving and all different sorts of innovation. I look forward to learning a whole lot with GitHub!

## General info

- I'm Brazilian, which means I know both English and Portuguese. Feel free to ask me any questions regarding language and its quirks;
- For the last couple of months, I've been focusing on front-end development, with such tools as HTML, CSS and JS;
- As stated before, I'm majoring in Information Systems at FIAP and it's been a wild ride so far;
- I haven't had any job-related experiences yet, but I _have_ been looking for an internship;
- Math, video games and composing (not songwriting) are some of my favorite hobbies, especially when I can have some spare time dedicated to them;

## My repositories?

Oh, I don't think I have that many of them at present. Fret not, though, for I'll be sure to add some interesting projects as soon as I finish them up all the way through!
